# super_resolution

This class project is a neural network designed for super-resolution of images, with variable upscaling but best results at 2x and 4x.

This architecture was eventually deployed with edits into the pipeline for the Purdue Aerial Robotics Team's object detection algorithms for identifying 8.5x11in targets from a drone 150ft+ above the ground, where standard camera resolution was not high enough for target classification.
